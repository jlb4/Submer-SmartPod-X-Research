# Submer-SmartPod-X-Research
During my Capstone (Senior) project to wrap up my time earning my B.S. in Computer Information Systems the Computer Science Class 4910 Capstone Seminar groups were assigned to work with industry partners to produce a deliverable to their specifications related to their technology. Submer donated their cutting edge completely immersive water-cooled server rack to test the benefit and highlight the benefit of their patented product the SmartPod X.  

In my group we were each responsible for adhering to the agile software development cycle with weekly sprints using the project management software Microsoft's Azure DevOps to produce software to test and research their fully submersible water-cooled server rack. My group and I spent around 12 weeks building from the ground up a testing methodology and process to clearly and quantifiable record and compare their product with the typical air-cooled environment that servers exist in today. 

From the equipment donated to Clemson CPSC SCALab (Scalable Computing and Analytics Lab) we devised a plan to remotely deploy testing software, namely various benchmarking software of various domains (rendering, hash cracking, etc.) on said servers, while creating our own in house resource management tools using various scripting tools (bash). After weekly meetings with our sponsors and the program coordinators we set on a plan and deployed testing in the air-cooled environment. Alas due to COVID-19 the installation of the pod was complete at Clemson University's Palmetto Supercomputing Cluster Facility, simultaneously all on campus and affiliated satellite sites were restricted to essential persons only. Hindering our ability to deploy our equipment into the pod and furthermore testing of their SmartPod X.

The equipment was setup using a jump server which was able to be accessed remotely through Clemson's VPN so testing of the air-cooled environment continued. From there we were able to remotely upload and test various benchmarking software such as the Phoronix Test Suite to run tests.

I was assigned with gathering, cleaning, and all associated data for the comparison. I primarily used the widely known data science language R to produce the comparative results and visual the data collected from both environments. I mainly contributed all data visualizations and linear regression results as well as help data collection through various scripts and sanitization of data for readability.

My time spent on this projected highlighted my passion for data science and its applications in real life situations such as contributing to showing the benefits of cutting-edge high-performance computing cooling alternatives.

In this repository will contain mainly my contributions to this project and the final paper that was submitted.
